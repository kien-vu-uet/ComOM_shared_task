My reason for purchasing the A630 is that it has almost all of the same features as my Canon G2 , minus the ability to mount an additional flash and some editing features , which are in the end useless especially if you have photo editing software like Adobe Photoshop . 	1

Do n't be fooled by the 640 's higher pixel rating of 10 megapixels . 	1

What was sharp at F/16 at 6MP gets softer at 10MP and you would need to use F11 instead , but that would result in more shallow dept of field ( DOF ) . 	1

Since this is nothing other than a simulated picture out of a much lower resolution , the digital zoom might as well be avoided and left to Photoshop ( or PhotoPaint etc. ) Given there is enough light , the picture quality is actually quite good and even better with a tripod at the longest zoom setting ( despite IS ) . 	1

D80 has different preset values for image customization than D200 , so the same `` normal '' settings give more saturate , more contrasty and perhaps more sharpened image . 	1

You can finally show someone a picture on the back of your camera and they can actually tell what it is :-) I must point out that even though it is much bigger and has much better resolution the LCD is still not so good that you can look at the image you have taken and KNOW you have nailed every critical focus or exposure detail . 	1
