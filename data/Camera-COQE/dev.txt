Another impressive feature for me was how long the battery life lasted , again comparing to my old and out of date camera , which only holds its charge for maybe 4-5 hours after a lot of deleting , this lasted the whole day I used it and was able to download my shots onto my computer , I would give 5/5 for this alone . 	1

I recently took a very huge leap and purchased the nikon d80 about 2 weeks ago . 	0

I just sold it for the D80 and here 's why : The new Nikon D80 is a 10 megapixel DSLR that essentially packs the same image quality of the D200 . 	1
[[15&&Nikon 16&&D80];[31&&D200];[27&&image 28&&quality];[26&&same];[0]]

For those that can afford it , this camera is more than capable of producing some stunning images at any experience level . 	0
[[];[];[];[];[]]
The reason is the full-frame sensor will give you a lot wider angle shot from the same lense class . 	1
[[5&&full-frame 6&&sensor];[];[13&&angle 14&&shot];[12&&wider];[1]]
There are specific settings on the turn dial which adjust settings such as the shutter speed and the aperature for you , along with a manual setting , in which you set your own settings . 	0

You can argue minutia and point out things like matrix meter pixel density , max frames per second , AF metering modes etc. ... but realistically the difference between the D200 and the D80 can be reduced to two points construction quality and the ability to use MF lenses on the D200 . 	1

I 'll keep this camera and be happy with it for a long time to come . 	0
